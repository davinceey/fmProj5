## My process
I used the CSS grid and the Flexbox property as well, for centering the elements and laying them out properly.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned
Learnt how to use the CSS grid property in laying out elements in a neat and responsive format.

### Continued development
I would still have to look into the CSS Grid system and understand more about it. I would also have to look out for better ways in making my website responsive, especially in the use of CSS properties and units.
