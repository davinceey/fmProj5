## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements

My greatest challenge was trying to ensure that my content was responsive in mobile layouts. Tried the clamp() and min() but to no avail. Please I would need sugestions on how ti improve my design.

## My process
I used the CSS grid and the Flexbox property as well, for centering the elements and laying them out properly.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned
Learnt how to use the CSS grid property in laying out elements in a neat and responsive format.

### Continued development
I would still have to look into the CSS Grid system and understand more about it. I would also have to look out for better ways in making my website responsive, especially in the use of CSS properties and units.
